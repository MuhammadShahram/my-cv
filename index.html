<h3>My Education</h3>
<P>I completed my 10th grade from DPS VEHARI, where I excelled in foundational subjects like biology, chemistry, and physics. This set the stage for my academic journey in the Pre-Medical field.</P>
<p>For my 2nd year, I pursued Pre-Medical studies at GC VEHARI. During this time, I gained a solid understanding of human biology, organic chemistry, and applied sciences. Although my academic focus was on medicine, I later discovered my passion for web development, which led me to transition into the tech world. The analytical thinking and problem-solving skills I developed in Pre-Medical have greatly contributed to my success in programming and web development.</p>
